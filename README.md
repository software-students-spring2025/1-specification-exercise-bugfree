## Stakeholders

### Cooper Lynch, NYU Student
#### Goals/Needs
- Complete important things on time, while maybe pushing back less important things
- Track the many deadlines that college students have
- Decouple the priority of a task and its deadline
- Separate ongoing and unstarted projects
- Get notified of upcoming task deadlines and personalize task planning
- Easy-to-read organization and prioritized usability
- Get personalized feedback on how long similar events took, and how often they were procrastinated

#### Problems/Frustrations
- Unclear prioritization or unusable interfaces with learning curves
- Frequent small changes to task priorities snowball into a need for major refactors/complete restarts later
- Due dates are often conflated with priority, or the time a project takes is not considered
- Current progress is often not considered in priority rankings
